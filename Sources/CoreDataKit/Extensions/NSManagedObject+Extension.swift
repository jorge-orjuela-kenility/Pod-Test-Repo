    ///   - predicate: The `NSPredicate` used to search for existing objects in the Core Data store. This predicate

    ///   - context: The `NSManagedObjectContext` within which the operation should be performed.
    ///              The context is used for both fetching and creating the object if necessary.
    /// - Throws: An error if the operation fails.
    /// - Returns: A `Model`, which is either the first object found that matches the predicate or a newly
    ///            created instance of the `Model` type if no matching object is found.
